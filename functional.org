* Overview

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Welcome all and thanks for coming.
Today we are going to talk about functional programming, (so if you are in the wrong room please run now).
We'll first see a bit of history, give an overview of probably the most iconic functional programming language,
and finally get to the juicy part, what we can do in Python and how.

I have a lot of material so sorry in advance if I might go a bit too fast, all the material will be available,
so just sit back and relax.

To just explain in two words who I am, I'm mainly a Python backend developer (even if now doing lots of devops work)
but have been for the last few years more and more interested in functional programming.
I did my bachelor thesis with Haskell long time ago, studied Clojure/Scala and today I just wanted
to share a bit of this knowledge to you.
I can't claim to be an expert though, I still have lots to learn, but I'm definitively enjoying the ride.

* History

** First there was lambda calculus

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Functional programming is a lot older than some people might think.
It was the early 1930 when Alonzo Church first introduced it, and wikipedia defines lambda calculus
as a turing complete, universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine.
This might sound a bit cryptic if you haven't studied computer science, but we could say to greatly simplify
that imperative program can be written functionally, and viceversa.

It's based on two extremely simple concepts, function abstraction and variable binding and substitution.

Just to clarify both Turing machines and lambda calculus can't really be used directly, but they are
extremely important as foundations of what we can actually compute.
#+END_NOTES

#+END_QUOTE

Imperative \equiv Functional

Lambda calculus is based on:

- function abstraction
- variable binding and substitution

** Lambda calculus primer

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Here is a simple example of how lambda calculus looks like.
The first function is just the identity function, given x it retuns x.
The second is a function that takes two arguments, and always returns the first 1.
In this case /y/ is a free variable, while x is a bound by the lambda.
The last example is a function returning another function.
The syntax itself is extremely simple and what's even more interesting is that there are only two reduction
rules, alpha which can be seen as simple renaming, and beta which actually does variable substitution.

I'll show a simple example in a second, but the interesting part is how little you need to define a formalism
that is able to define all possible valid programs.
#+END_NOTES

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - function definitions
    * $\lambda x. x$
    * $\lambda x y. x$
    * $\lambda x. \lambda y. x$

  - Reduction rules
    * \alpha reduction (renaming)
    * \beta reduction (substitution)

** Lisp

#+BEGIN_NOTES
In 1958 Lisp was invented, and at the time the other two mainstream languages were Fortran and Assembly.
This is quite impressive considering that for example C was created in the 1970s.
Lisp was greatly inspired by Lambda calculus, as we can see from these examples the syntax is basically the same.
In the higher order function example we can see a *defun* and a *lambda*, which are exactly the same as *def* and *lambda*
in Python, a named and an anonymous function.
Lambda calculus didn't have named functions for example but obviously a language that can't name things is not very practical
in the end.
So then we can see a very simple substitution (the beta reduction we were talking about), if I apply the higher-order
function to 2 and apply the result of that to 3 I get this chain of evaluation.
#+END_NOTES

Originally specified in *1958*, with Fortran and Assembly.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun id (x) x) ; $\lambda x. x

  (defun discard-second (x y) (x)) ; \lambda x y. x

  (defun higher-order (x) (lambda (y) x)) ; \lambda x. \lambda y. x

#+END_SRC

Sample substitution:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ((higher-order 2) 3)  ; same as higher-order(2)(3)
  ((lambda (y) 2) 3)         ; same as (lambda y: 2)(3)

#+END_SRC

** Typed lambda calculus
   
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Typed lambda calculus is a generalisation of lambda calculus, still introduced by Alonzo,
and can be defined as is a typed interpretation of the lambda calculus with only one type
constructor: \rightarrow that builds function types.

In short it means that we add the capability to define types into the calculus, and it was the
foundation of other funtional languages like ML and Haskel.
The identify function is more or less the same as you can see, and in Haskell we can just
define it like this.
The double colon in Haskell defines the type, and a is just a generic type, which means
that id works for every possible type.
#+END_NOTES

Introduced in *1940* by Alonzo Church.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
is a typed interpretation of the lambda calculus with only one type

#+END_QUOTE

For every type \tau:
*identity* $\lambda x:\tau . x: \tau \rightarrow \tau$

Foundation to ML and Haskell (1990):
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  id :: a - > a
  id x = x
#+END_SRC

** Back to the present

#+BEGIN_NOTES
If we go back to 2016 the scenario we see it's really interesting, because there are languages
like Haskell that it's not just an academic toy anymore, but used also by companies like Facebook
that has millions of lines of Haskell in their hyper sophisticated anti-spam system.
Clojure and Clojurescript (a quite new lisp dialect) are also growing a lot, used by companies like
Deutsche bank/Walmart/mail online and much more.
Erlang is much older but was for example one of the causes of the success of whatsapp.
It's a functioal programming language incredibly strong on concurrency, and there are stories
that say that they were capable of handling millions of concurrent requests on a single node
using Erlang at Whatsapp.

Scala is another interesting language, and combines both OOP and FP quite nicely, having a massive
success the Java world.

Even java added lambdas to the core language...

* Why

** Rip OOP

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Most people have been taught OOP and still use that as main paradigm at work.
This quote from a professor at Carniage Mellon University explains quite
well why OOP might not be the best choice in 2016 anymore.
There are many universities that are in fact using Haskell/Ocaml or other FP
languages to new students.

#+END_NOTES

 [[./images/oop_rip.jpg]]

#+begin_quote
 Object-oriented programming is both anti-modular and
 anti-parallel by its very nature, and hence unsuitable for a modern CS
 curriculum.

 Robert Harper (professor at Carniage Mellon University)

 #+end_quote

** FP advantages

- easier concurrency
- better composability
- easier to test code

** Why not everyone doing it?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
If it's all so much better why not everyone is already doing it?
Well first it is actually happening and fp concepts are spreading more and more in every area.
This graph however explains quite well for me what the problem is.
Everyone can easily understand easily imperative programming, since you just tell the computer
what to do.
OOP adds some complexity but still everyone can quickly grasp concepts what's an object is,
what inheritance mean and so and so forth.
Functions and things like Monads/Monoids and functors are a lot hard to grasp, since they come
from quite abstract mathematical concepts.
However as this very scientific graph shows the rewards are massive, and will take your
programming to the next level.

* What?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Trying to define functional programming is not that easy, since as we could
see lambda calculus was just a very primitive mathematical foundation.
Many functional programming languages differ also quite significantly, but
these principles are quite general.
We are going to see very soon examples of all these concepts in both Haskell and Python.

  - Functions are *first class* citizens: higher-order, partial application, currying..
  - Data is immutable
  - sequences are *lazy* by default
  - Functions are *pure*

** Haskell (1990)

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 The original intention was to talk about Python but in reality
 my first real encounter with FP was with Haskell and that's probably
 the main reason why I got interested in it.

 Haskell is a relatively old language (same age as Python) but it has
 been for most of its history a niche research language, that people
 used to write papers with.

 It's probably until now the most "complete" and pure functional programming
 language out there, and in some ways it's just incredibly beautiful.

 This joke here refers to the fact that while there is so much interest in
 Haskell not as many people use it in production, but in any case
 it's still probably the best language to really learn functional programming.

 *Composable*: They interoperate due to their use of core data structures.
 *Pure*: They don’t change their inputs or rely on external state.
 *Lazy*: They don’t run until absolutely necessary, allowing them to support large streaming data sets.

*** Toolz capabilities
