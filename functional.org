* Overview

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Welcome all and thanks for coming.
Today we are going to talk about functional programming, (so if you are in the wrong room please run now).
We'll first see a bit of history, give an overview of probably the most iconic functional programming language,
and finally get to the juicy part, what we can do in Python and how.

I have a lot of material so sorry in advance if I might go a bit too fast, all the material will be available,
so just sit back and relax.

To just explain in two words who I am, I'm mainly a Python backend developer (even if now doing lots of devops work)
but have been for the last few years more and more interested in functional programming.
I did my bachelor thesis with Haskell long time ago, studied Clojure/Scala and today I just wanted
to share a bit of this knowledge to you.
I can't claim to be an expert though, I still have lots to learn, but I'm definitively enjoying the ride.

** First there was lambda calculus

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Functional programming is a lot older than some people might think.
It was the early 1930 when Alonzo Church first introduced it, and wikipedia defines lambda calculus
as a turing complete, universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine.
This might sound a bit cryptic if you haven't studied computer science, but we could say to greatly simplify
that imperative program can be written functionally, and viceversa.

It's based on two extremely simple concepts, function abstraction and variable binding and substitution.

Just to clarify both Turing machines and lambda calculus can't really be used directly, but they are
extremely important as foundations of what we can actually compute.
#+END_NOTES

#+END_QUOTE

Imperative \equiv Functional

Lambda calculus is based on:

- function abstraction
- variable binding and substitution

** Lambda calculus primer

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Here is a simple example of how lambda calculus looks like.
The first function is just the identity function, given x it retuns x.
The second is a function that takes two arguments, and always returns the first 1.
In this case /y/ is a free variable, while x is a bound by the lambda.
The last example is a function returning another function.
The syntax itself is extremely simple and what's even more interesting is that there are only two reduction
rules, alpha which can be seen as simple renaming, and beta which actually does variable substitution.

I'll show a simple example in a second, but the interesting part is how little you need to define a formalism
that is able to define all possible valid programs.

  - function definitions
    * $\lambda x. x$
    * $\lambda x y. x$
    * $\lambda x. \lambda y. x$

  - Reduction rules
    * \alpha reduction (renaming)
    * \beta reduction (substitution)

** Lisp

#+BEGIN_NOTES
In 1958 Lisp was invented, and 
#+END_NOTES

Originally specified in *1958*, with Fortran and Assembly.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun id (x) x) ; $\lambda x. x

  (defun discard-second (x y) (x)) ; \lambda x y. x

  (defun higher-order (x) (lambda (y) x)) ; \lambda x. \lambda y. x

#+END_SRC

Sample substitution:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (higher-order 2)
  (lambda (y) 2)
#+END_SRC

** Typed lambda calculus
   
Introduced in *1940* by Alonzo Church.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
is a typed interpretation of the lambda calculus with only one type
constructor: \rightarrow that builds function types.
#+END_QUOTE

For every type \tau:
*identity* $\lambda x:\tau . x: \tau \rightarrow \tau$

Foundation to ML and Haskell:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  id :: a - > a
  id x = x

 Object-oriented programming is both anti-modular and
 anti-parallel by its very nature, and hence unsuitable for a modern CS
 curriculum.

* What?

#+BEGIN_NOTES

#+END_NOTES

Programming paradigm based on *lambda calculus* (Alonzo Church)

- /functions/ are *first class* citizens
  - higher-order functions
  - partial application
  - currying

- Functions are *pure*
  - immutable data: *no state*
  - encapsulated side effects

- lazy sequences

** What if
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: ./images/what_if_functional.jpg

   :END:

* What's in for me

- easier concurrency
- better composability
- easier to write tests
- more generic abstractions

* Haskell (1990)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The original intention was to talk about Python but in reality
my first real encounter with FP was with Haskell and that's probably
the main reason why I got interested in it.

Haskell is a relatively old language (same age as Python) but it has
been for most of its history a niche research language, that people
used to write papers with.

It's probably until now the most "complete" and pure functional programming
language out there, and in some ways it's just incredibly beautiful.

This joke here refers to the fact that while there is so much interest in
Haskell not as many people use it in production, but in any case
it's still probably the best language to really learn functional programming.

  - lazy
  - pattern matching

* Four pillars

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Now we are going to see more in detail four concepts from functional programming,
and exploring them in Python and Haskell, comparing the two together.

The first pillar is function and function composition, so what functions actually are,
what are their propreties and how do we compose them.
The second is immutability, which is simply the idea of trying to never mutate your
data in place, but always create new objects for every mutation.

Streaming refers to the ability to work on infinite infinite sequences, and finally
purity refers to the absence of side effects.
#+END_NOTES

  * Function composition (toolz/stdlib)
  * Immutability (toolz)
  * Streaming (itertools/toolz)
  * Purity?
  * Types (mypy/voluptuous?)
  * Pattern matching ?

# TODO remove libraries from here if already mentioning them above
Libraries used:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  * itertools
  * functools
  * toolz
  * fn.py
  * mypy

* What's a function, really

** Mathematical definition

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs
with the property that each input is related to exactly one output. 
#+END_QUOTE

[[./images/function.png]]

** Def and Lambda

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def adder(a, b):
      return a + b

  adder_lambda = lambda a, b: a + b

  adder(1, 2) # -> 3
  adder_lambda(1, 2) # -> 3

  type(adder) == type(adder_lambda) == function # -> True

#+END_SRC

** Class?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  * Callable class
   
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      class Adder:
          def __call__(self, a, b):
              return a + b

      my_adder = Adder()
      type(my_adder) # Adder
      my_adder(1, 2) # -> 3
    #+END_SRC

  * Generic callable interface
    
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      callable(adder)   # -> true
      callable(my_adder) # -> true
    #+END_SRC

** Other functions?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  * Let's define a method and call it:
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      class Santa:
          def give_gift(self, kid, gift):
              print("Good boy {}, here is your {}".format(kid, gift))
    
      my_santa = Santa()
      my_santa.give_gift('boy', 'toy') # -> Good boy boy, here is your toy
    #+END_SRC

  * What is actually give_gift?
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      type(Santa.give_gift) # -> function
    #+END_SRC

  * So we can just do this instead:
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      my_santa = Santa()
      Santa.give_gift(my_santa, 'boy', 'toy') # -> Good boy boy, here is your toy
    #+END_SRC


* Toolz

Toolz provides a suite of functions which have the following functional virtues:

*Composable*: They interoperate due to their use of core data structures.
*Pure*: They don’t change their inputs or rely on external state.
*Lazy*: They don’t run until absolutely necessary, allowing them to support large streaming data sets.

** Toolz capabilities

 - *Dicttoolz*: immutable dictionaries functionality
 - *Functoolz*: extend functools
 - *Itertoolz*: extend itertools

* Immutability

** The mutable way:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def enrich_dict_mutable(dic):
      for key in dic:
          if key % 2 == 0:
              dic[key] = 'bar'

      keys_below_zero = [x for x in dic if x < 0]
      for neg in keys_below_zero:
          del dic[neg]

      return dic
#+END_SRC

** Go immutable


* Function composition
** Partial application

   *Haskell*:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  my_sum:: Num a => -> a -> a -> a
  my_sum a b = a + b
  add_three = my_sum 3
  
  add_three 2 == 5
#+END_SRC

   *Python*:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from toolz.functoolz import partial

  def my_sum(a, b):
      return a + b

  add_three = partial(my_sum, 3)
#+END_SRC

** Currying

   *Haskell*:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  my_sum:: Num a => -> a -> a -> a
  my_sum a b = a + b

  Prelude> :t my_sum 1
  my_sum 1 :: Num a => a -> a

  (my_sum 1) 2 == (my_sum 1 2)
#+END_SRC

   *Python*:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from toolz.functoolz import curry

  def my_sum(a, b):
      return a + b

  my_sum(a)(b) == my_sum(a, b)
#+END_SRC

** Composition

 *Haskell*:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  import Data.Char (toUpper)

  get_first:: [a] -> a
  get_first lis = lis !! 0

  upper_first_letter:: [Char] -> Char
  upper_first_letter = toUpper . get_first

#+END_SRC

 *Python*:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from toolz.functoolz import compose
  from toolz.curried import get


  upcase_first_letter = compose(
      get(0), # lambda l: l[0]
      lambda c: c.upper(),
  )

  upcase_first_letter('hello') == 'hello'[0].upper() == 'H'
#+END_SRC

** Pipes!

Who gets a gift for Christmas??

#+BEGIN_SRC 
    people = [
        {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 10, 'well_behaved': True},
        {'name': 'Rick', 'age': 10, 'well_behaved': False},

          if person['age'] < 18 and person['well_behaved']:
              getting_gifts.append(person['name'])

      return getting_gifts

#+END_SRC

*** Toolz pipes

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def get_gifts(people):
      # ``pipe(data, f, g, h)`` is equivalent to ``h(g(f(data)))`
      return pipe(people,
          filter(lambda v: v['age'] < 18 and v['well_behaved']),
          mapcat(get(['name'])),
          list)
#+END_SRC

          ev += 2


  gen_ev = evens()
  for n in range(10):
      print(next(gen_ev))
#+END_SRC

    *Smarter Python*:

  def neg(x):
      return -x

  # ... but that doesn't stop us from using it anyway.
  neg * Just(9)                 # returns Just(-9)
  neg * Nothing                 # returns Nothing
  neg * List(1, 2, 3, 4)        # returns List(-1, -2, -3, -4)
