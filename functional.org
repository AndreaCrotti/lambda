* What?

#+BEGIN_NOTES

#+END_NOTES

Programming paradigm based on *lambda calculus* (Alonzo Church)

- /functions/ are *first class* citizens
  - higher-order functions
  - partial application
  - currying

- Functions are *pure*
  - immutable data: *no state*
  - encapsulated side effects

- lazy sequences

* Lambda calculus


* Why should I bother

- *concurrent* world
- OOP is doesn't compose well
- threading is hard and painful
- it's here to stay

** RIP OOP?

#+begin_quote
 Object-oriented programming is both anti-modular and
 anti-parallel by its very nature, and hence unsuitable for a modern CS
 curriculum.

 Robert Harper (professor at Carniage Mellon University)

* What's in for me

- easier concurrency
- better composability
- easier to write tests
- more generic abstractions

* Haskell (1990)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The original intention was to talk about Python but in reality
my first real encounter with FP was with Haskell and that's probably
the main reason why I got interested in it.

Haskell is a relatively old language (same age as Python) but it has
been for most of its history a niche research language, that people
used to write papers with.

It's probably until now the most "complete" and pure functional programming
language out there, and in some ways it's just incredibly beautiful.

This joke here refers to the fact that while there is so much interest in
Haskell not as many people use it in production, but in any case
it's still probably the best language to really learn functional programming.

* Python functional Christmas

** Imperative

#+BEGIN_SRC python

#+END_SRC

** OOP 

** Functional

* Map reduce & co

** No more looping

* Functools

* Itertools

* Toolz

Toolz provides a suite of functions which have the following functional virtues:

*Composable*: They interoperate due to their use of core data structures.
*Pure*: They don’t change their inputs or rely on external state.
*Lazy*: They don’t run until absolutely necessary, allowing them to support large streaming data sets.

** Toolz capabilities

 - *Dicttoolz*: immutable dictionaries functionality
 - *Functoolz*: extend functools
 - *Itertoolz*: extend itertools

** Immutable dictionaries

Problem:

Given 

*** The mutable way:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def enrich_dict_mutable(dic):
      for key in dic:
          if key % 2 == 0:
              dic[key] = 'bar'

      keys_below_zero = [x for x in dic if x < 0]
      for neg in keys_below_zero:
          del dic[neg]

      return dic
#+END_SRC

** Partial application

   *Haskell*:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  my_sum:: Num a => -> a -> a -> a
  my_sum a b = a + b
  add_three = my_sum 3
  
  add_three 2 == 5
#+END_SRC

   *Python*:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from toolz.functoolz import partial

  def my_sum(a, b):
      return a + b

  add_three = partial(my_sum, 3)
#+END_SRC

** Currying

   *Haskell*:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  my_sum:: Num a => -> a -> a -> a
  my_sum a b = a + b

  Prelude> :t my_sum 1
  my_sum 1 :: Num a => a -> a

  (my_sum 1) 2 == (my_sum 1 2)
#+END_SRC

   *Python*:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from toolz.functoolz import curry

  def my_sum(a, b):
      return a + b

  my_sum(a)(b) == my_sum(a, b)
#+END_SRC

** Composition

 *Haskell*:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  import Data.Char (toUpper)

  get_first:: [a] -> a
  get_first lis = lis !! 0

  upper_first_letter:: [Char] -> Char
  upper_first_letter = toUpper . get_first

#+END_SRC

 *Python*:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from toolz.functoolz import compose
  from toolz.curried import get


  upcase_first_letter = compose(
      get(0), # lambda l: l[0]
      lambda c: c.upper(),
  )

  upcase_first_letter('hello') == 'hello'[0].upper() == 'H'
#+END_SRC

** Pipes!

Who gets a gift for Christmas??

#+BEGIN_SRC 
    people = [
        {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 10, 'well_behaved': True},
        {'name': 'Rick', 'age': 10, 'well_behaved': False},
        {'name': 'John', 'age': 20, 'well_behaved': True},
    ]

#+END_SRC

*** Classic loopy

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def get_gifts_classic(people):
      getting_gifts = []
      for person in people:
          if person['age'] < 18 and person['well_behaved']:
              getting_gifts.append(person['name'])

      return getting_gifts

#+END_SRC

*** Toolz pipes

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def get_gifts(people):
      # ``pipe(data, f, g, h)`` is equivalent to ``h(g(f(data)))`
      return pipe(people,
          filter(lambda v: v['age'] < 18 and v['well_behaved']),
          mapcat(get(['name'])),
          list)
#+END_SRC

** Iterables

* Mypy

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def typed_addition(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      return a + b
#+END_SRC

* Side effects

** Pure computation?


[[./images/haskell.png]]

** Monads to the rescue

** Call me Maybe

[[./images/maybe.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
#+END_SRC



* Testing

** Quickcheck

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  import Test.QuickCheck

  prop_revapp :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Bool
  prop_revapp xs ys = reverse (xs++ys) == reverse xs ++ reverse ys

  main = quickCheck prop_revapp
#+END_SRC

** Hypothesis

* Putting it all together

* Python lacking

- TCO (Tail Call Optimization)
- Persistent data structures
- Types?

* Quotes

** 10 100

 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 "It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures." —Alan Perlis
 #+END_QUOTE
   
** Describing

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Functional programming is like describing your problem to a mathematician.
Imperative programming is like giving instructions to an idiot. - Arcus #scheme
#+END_QUOTE

** Cloud

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  OOP cannot save us from the Cloud Monster anymore. - Ju Gonçalves
#+END_QUOTE

** Functions

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Functional Programming is so called because a program consists entirely of functions.

- John Hughes, Why Functional Programming Matters

#+END_QUOTE

** Python FP

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
using Python for Functional Programming it's like looking at a beautiful view through a dirty window -
