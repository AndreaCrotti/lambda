* Functional programming

** Why FP

** Lambda calculus

   - currying
   - higher order function
   - map/reduce/whatever

** Side effects and immutability

   - what is a side effect
   - why is it bad
   - how to encapsulate them properly

** Design principles

   - OOP issues
   - designing without classes
   - composition over inheritance
   - parallel with all the states in the universe and how to test with that

** Python and functions
   
   - what is a function in Python
   - decorators short intro
   - methods/classmethods/functions and behaviour

** Toolz
   
   - toolz.itemmap(reversed, dic)

** Generators and higher order functions

   - infinite streams
   - relationship between streams and pure functions

** Testing

   - testing pure functions
   - show the refactor example from the crappy solution to testing with hypothesis

** Resources

   - Okasaki for persistent data structures
